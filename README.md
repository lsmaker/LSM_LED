# LSM_LED
This module uses one of the digital pins from the Arduino board to output a square wave that can be used to control an external LED creating a periodic blinking effect. The digital pin used and the blinking period value can be passed by the user to the class constructor.

# Example
```
#include <LSMaker.h>
#include <LSM_LED.h>

using namespace LSM;

#define PIN_LED 13        //Must be a digital pin!
#define BLINK_PERIOD 1000 //In milliseconds!

LED *led = new LED(PIN_LED,BLINK_PERIOD);

void setup(){
  LSMaker::init();
  LSMaker::addModule(led);
}

void loop(){
  //Do something else if you want here. This code will not affect the LED
  //blinking effect even is using blocking instructions.
}
```
